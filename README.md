To run the app on your local machine:

### Run server application
From `server/` directory

`$ npm install`

`$ postgres` (may have to run with `-D /usr/local/var/postgres`) or boot up the [Posrgres client for Mac](https://postgresapp.com/)
  - default config for postgres user is "postgres", yours might be this or the name of your system user
  - can change this in `server/db/config/config.json`
  
`$ npm run db:create;npm run db:migrate;npm run db:seed`

`$ npm run dev` should run the app on localhost port `9000`

We will be able to direct all local API requests from the client to our server thanks to a proxy setting in the client's package.json.

### Run client application
From `client/` directory

`$ npm install`

`$ npm run start`
